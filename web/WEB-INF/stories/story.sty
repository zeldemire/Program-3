<PAGE>There are many different ways to teach a database course. The chapters in Parts 1 through 7 can be used in an introductory course on
database systems in the order that they are given or in the preferred order of individual instructors. Selected chapters
 and sections may be left out, and the instructor can add other chapters from the rest of the book, depending on the emphasis
 of the course. At the end of the open- ing section of many of the bookâ€™s chapters, we list sections that are candidates for
 being left out whenever a less-detailed discussion of the topic is desired. We suggest covering up to Chapter 15 in an introductory
 database course and including selected parts of other chapters, depending on the background of the students and the desired coverage.
  For an emphasis on system implementation techniques, chapters from Parts 7, 8, and 9 should replace some of the earlier chapters.
</PAGE><PAGE>Chapters 7 and 8, which cover conceptual modeling using the ER and EER models, are important for a good conceptual understanding of
databases. However, they may be partially covered, covered later in a course, or even left out if the emphasis is on DBMS implementation.
 Chapters 17 and 18 on file organizations and indexing may also be covered early, later, or even left out if the emphasis is on database mod- els and languages.
  For students who have completed a course on file organization, parts of these chapters can be assigned as reading material or
  some exercises can be assigned as a review for these concepts.</PAGE>
